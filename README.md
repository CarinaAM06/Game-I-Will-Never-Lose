# Game-I-Will-Never-Lose
## OVERVIEW
I am terrible at games, so I wanted to make a game in which I will never lose. No matter who I am playing against, the game will favor me and I will always win!
## GOALS
1. Research
2. Plan & Design


## SPECIFICATIONS
- I will be using Python since I started taking a Python class at UCF and I wanted to improve my skills using Python
= It will be a fighting mode game similar to Street Fighters
- When the user is “Carina”, a huge muscular guy who is impossible to beat will automatically become the character
- Any other name will make the character become an old lady on a walker

## Research/Brainstorming
- After a lot of research I decided to try and use the Pygame extension to make the game
- I also found a video of someone making a fighting game using Pygame in which I will use as the skeleton for my own game
